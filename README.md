### What exactly is Safe?

__At its core, Safe is an app that allows users to easily document events where they may be in harms way. A simple press of a button is all it takes to activate it.__

This means that anyone with Safe has the power to document and record everything from police encounters to domestic violence. Encounters recorded with Safe are immediately uploaded to the cloud allowing users to access everything from any smartphone. 

One of Safe's primary strengths is the ability to do everything at once. With the simple press of a button, Safe will automatically take care of everything needed to ensure the documentation of a potentially dangerous event. This allows our users to forget about having to document said event. The last thing that you want to worry about being in a situation like this is having to record all of it properly.

> For example, Safe could document an incident of police brutality and bring key evidence to light in a court house. This would give the judge and the jury a complete view of what, where, and when the situation happened.

### Core features:

- __Visual Documentation__ | With one tap, both the front and the back camera will start recording. This feature allows for a complete representation of what happened.

- __Location Recording__ | With this feature, the exact location of the incident will  be documented. This allows the user to pin point where everything took place.

- __Notifies Emergency Contacts__ | With this feature, the exact location of the incident will  be documented. This allows the user to pin point where everything took place

- __Uploads to The Cloud__ | All data recorded is uploaded to the cloud for safe keeping. This permits the user to access their information from another device in case the original device is lost or broken.

- __Secured Data__ | Safe uses the latest in data security. Many of the technologies used were pioneered by fintechs and used across the world to keep data safe.

- __Privacy Focused__ | Safe will never sell or lend user's data to a third party (anyone really). The user will always decide what happens with their data.

- __Multiple Device Inclusion__ | Safe allows for multiple devices to maximize use of the app. This way, users will never have to worry about not having a way to document an incident.
